            lb <= v <= ub
            x and w are binary variables, v are continuous

        - x are the metabolites:
          x=1 for metabolites produced/consumed,
          x=0 for metabolites that are not produced/consumed

        - w[i][j] stands for reaction j that produces/consumes metabolite i
          w[i][j] = 1 if the reaction is active
          w[i][j] = 0 if the reaction is inactive

        - v[j] is the flux of reaction j

        - S[i][j] is the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite i on reaction j

        - e is a small constant, M is the number of reactions in the model

        - lb and ub are the lower and upper bounds, respectively,  of
          a given reaction flux

        - R is the set of all reversible reactions

        - IR is the set of all irreversible reactions
