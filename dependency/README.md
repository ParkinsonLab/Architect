This folder contains either code or instructions to modify existing code for tools that are used by Architect.  Please look in the specific folder for further information about each tool.  
These dependencies are not required if only enzyme annotation is to be performed; however, CarveMe and framed are required for model reconstruction.  Please note that the versions of CarveMe and framed here differ from the original versions published by the authors, as per requirements for running Architect.  EnzDP installation is recommended for enzyme annotation but not obligatory.
